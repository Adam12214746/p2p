The code I provided implements a basic server that can handle multiple clients and perform various operations with files. Clients can send and visualize images, CSV files, and JSON files, as well as broadcast files to other connected clients.

To use this code, you need to replace the placeholders `SERVER_IP` and `SERVER_PORT` with your desired server IP address and port number. Make sure to have the necessary file formats available to send and visualize.

Once the server is running, clients can connect to it and choose an operation from the menu. Here's a summary of the available operations:

1. Send and visualize an image: The client can choose an image file and send it to the server. The server receives the image, saves it as "received_image.jpg", and opens it for visualization.

2. Send and visualize a CSV file: The client can choose a CSV file and send it to the server. The server receives the file, saves it as "received_data.csv", and prints its contents row by row.

3. Send and visualize a JSON file: The client can choose a JSON file and send it to the server. The server receives the file, saves it as "received_data.json", and prints its contents.

4. Broadcast a file: The client can choose a file and provide its path. The server will then broadcast the file to all connected clients.

5. Exit: The client can choose to exit the program.

Make sure to have the necessary file formats available for sending and visualization. When a file is received, it will be saved with a predefined name ("received_image.jpg", "received_data.csv", or "received_data.json").

You can run the server script on your machine, and then run the client script on multiple client machines to connect to the server and perform the desired file operations.

Note: This code is a basic implementation and may require further enhancements and error handling for a complete and robust system.
